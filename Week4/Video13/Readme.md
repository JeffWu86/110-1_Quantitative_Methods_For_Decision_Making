```R
# number sign (#) can be used to prompt R to ignore anything that follows

# Create a new script: File -> New File -> R Script
# Or open an existing file in folder File -> Open File


# Submit a code rather than copy a code, place the cursor on the line of code we would like to have submitted and then click on the "Run" option
# Or a keyboard shortcut "command + Enter" in Mac or "Ctrl + Enter"
# Highligth the code we would like to enter and select "Run"

# comment and uncomment lines: Select Code -> Comment/Uncomment Lines 

# Tab key will return to you a list of suggestions or variables of what you may be looking for

# Save the file: File -> Save As...
```
